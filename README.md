## Explanation

The knights-travails project is a challenge provided by The Odin Project, an open-source web development course.

The goal of this challenge is to create a psueudo binary tree for a knight chess piece, create and apply a search algorithm of your choice, and find the shortest path to a given square of the board.

I ended up using a simple breadth-first-search algorithm to find the shortest path, although there are many other more efficient searching algorithms that could be applied in the future.
